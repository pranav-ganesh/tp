CallMeMaybe (CMM) is a **desktop app** centered for Telemarketers in aiding them in customer contact management.
CMM provides a solution to quickly catalog people based on who has/yet to be called.
The in-built tracking functionality serves as a reminder to reach back on previously unreachable customers.
Importing and exporting of existing customer database is also supported by CMM to facilitate team-based environments.


CMM is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, CMM can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## How to use the User Guide

This user guide aims to help you easily find the information you desire for any command. <br>
Each Command section is separated into:<br>
* Brief description of the command
* Command Format
* Things to note
* Examples
* Common issues

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:** Straightforward commands such as 'list' may not have the sections "Things to note", "examples" and "Common issues"
</div>

To get the most out of this user guide, it is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the [notations](#command-notations) we use.
However, if this is your first time using CMM, it would be easier for you to go through the [Quick Start](#quick-start) and learn the 
notations along the way. Hope you have a great time with CMM.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start
1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest CallMeMaybe.jar from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for CMM.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. Initially, a popup asking to import CSV data would appear.
   ![importPopUpUi](images/importPopUpMessage.png) <br>
   To learn more about importing CSV data, click [here](#importing-the-data-into-database). Otherwise, to quickly get started, simply click any button
   on the popup and a GUI similar to the screenshot below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing "help" and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.
   You can find the commands that CallMeMaybe supports below:
   - `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com` : Adds a contact named John Doe to the CMM database.
   - `list` : Lists all contacts.
   - `called 2` : Marks the 2nd contact shown in the current list as called.
   - `edit 1 n/Bob p/62353535` : Edits the name and phone number of the first person in the displayed list.
   - `findAny n/alex g/m` : Finds the contacts that have the substring `alex`in their name **AND/OR** are males.
   - `findAll n/alex g/m` : Finds the contacts that have both the substring `alex` in their name **AND** are males.
   - `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
   - `display 4` : Displays the full contact details of the fourth contact in the displayed list.
   - `filter called` : Sorts the list to display uncalled contacts first
   - `clear` : Deletes all contacts.
   - `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Remember to clear the sample data using `clear` command before adding your own data.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

### Command Notations

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [g/GENDER]` can be used as `n/John Doe g/M` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[i/INTEREST]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `i/running`, `i/running i/watching tv` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command is specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a contact: `add`

**Things to note:**
* `list` shows all contacts in ascending order by name.

### Marking a contact as called : `called`

Marks the specified contact from the address book as called. (i.e. person has already been called)

Format: `called INDEX`

Example:
* `called 3` marks the 3rd contact in the displayed list as Called

**Things to note:**

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
* Specifying (INTERESTLIST INDEX) is optional as well. <br/>
* If (INTERESTLIST INDEX) is specified, the interest at that index would be updated. <br/>
* If it is not, then an interest would be added to the list instead. <br/>
* You can refer to the examples below for a better understanding of the edit command functionality.
</div>

Examples:
* `edit 1 n/Malan i/[2] Swimming` edits the name of contact and the second interest of the first contact in the displayed list
* `edit 1 i/Painting i/[1] Running` adds 'painting' as an interest and edits the first interest of the first contact in the displayed list

[c/CALLED…​] [i/INTEREST…​]`

**Things to note:**
* FindAny requires at least one field. But it is optional to include all the fields. <br>
* If there are duplicate fields, CMM will only take the right-most field <br>
eg. `findAny n/alex n/david` returns the same results as `findAny n/david`
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `n/hans` will return the same result `n/Hans` <br>
* Any number of keywords can be specified within each field <br>
* The order of the keywords within each field does not matter. e.g. `n/Hans Bo` will return the same result
  as `n/Bo Hans`<br>
* Keywords for `Called` are limited to `true`, `false`, `t`, `f`
* Keywords for `Gender` are limited to `male`, `female`, `m`, `f`

findAll vs findAny<br>
    * findAll searches for contacts that satisfy **ALL** the fields specified<br>
    * findAny searches for contacts that satisfy **ANY** of the fields specified<br>
</div>

Click [here](#finding-contacts-that-matches-all-the-keywords-specified--findall) to learn more about findAll

Examples:
* `findAny n/John` finds all contacts that have the substring `john` in their name

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
findAll vs findAny: <br>
- findAll searches for contacts that satisfy **ALL** the fields specified<br>
- findAny searches for contacts that satisfy **ANY** of the fields specified<br>
</div>

Click [here](#finding-contacts-that-matches-any-of-the-keywords-specified-findany) to learn more about findAny

Examples:
* `findAll n/alex` finds all the contacts that have the substring 'alex' in their name

**Common issues:**
* _Unknown command_: <br/>
  a. Using `findany` instead of `findAny` (not capitalising the 'A')
* _Invalid command format!_: <br>
  a. No fields provided<br>
  b. Used the wrong prefix (eg. '/n' instead of 'n/')
  c. Did not specify either 't', 'f', 'true', 'false' after `c/`
  d. Did not specify either 'm', 'f', 'male', 'female', 'n.a' after `g/`

### Displaying full contact details : `display`

Displays additional information of a particular contact stored in the application. These include the
address, gender, age and their interests.

The full details of the contact are shown on the right side of the application (inside the white box).
![displayUi](images/displayUi.png)

Format: `display INDEX`

Example:
* `display 3` displays full contact details of the 3rd contact in the displayed list

**Common issues:**
* _The index provided is invalid_: <br />
  a. Displayed list does not contain contact at `INDEX`
  b. Index specified is larger than 2147483647
  c. Index specified is not a positive integer

### Filtering contacts : `filter`

Filters the existing contacts in the CMM database. The displayed list will show contacts sorted by the chosen category.

Format: `filter CATEGORY [COUNT]`

**Things to note:**
* `CATEGORY` field is mandatory
* `CATEGORY` refers to the category used to filter the contacts
* `CATEGORY` **must be one of the following:** called, gender
* `COUNT` refers to the number of contacts to be shown in the displayed list. If `COUNT` is more than the total number
  of contacts, all contacts will be shown
* `COUNT` **must be a positive integer less than 2147483648** 1, 2, 3, …​, 2147483647
* If more arguments are given than what is required, the last two arguments are taken into account
  (e.g., `filter gender called 2` will be interpreted as `filter called 2`)
* If the last argument is not an integer, it will be interpreted as a `CATEGORY`
  (e.g., `filter gender called` will be interpreted as `filter called`)
* If more than one category is entered, the last category will be interpreted as the `CATEGORY`
  (e.g., `filter gender called 3` will be interpreted as `filter called 3`)
* If only one argument is given, it will be interpreted as a `CATEGORY`
  (e.g., `filter 1000` will cause `1000` to be interpreted as a `CATEGORY`)

Examples:
* `filter called` filters the displayed list to show uncalled contacts first
* `filter called 2` filters the displayed list to show uncalled contacts first and to only show the first two contacts
* `filter gender 3` filters the displayed list to show female contacts first and to only show the first three contacts

**Common issues:**
* _Category can only be either "called" or "gender"_: <br />
  a. The category specified is not `called` or `gender` <br />
  b. Category not specified
* _Count is not a non-zero unsigned integer_: <br />
  a. The last argument is not a positive integer

### Clearing all contacts : `clear`

Clears all contacts from the CMM database.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** Clearing is irreversible, please use with caution.
</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the User Guide.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

CMM data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Importing the data into database

CMM is able to import Excel files into CMM. The import files have to be in an Excel Csv format (semicolon delimited).

**Steps to Import from Excel file**
1. Ensure that the Excel file is a Csv file with **semicolon delimited**.
   Instructions on how to import to this file type can be found [here](SettingImportFileType.md)
2. Ensure that the import file is named import.csv under the "data" folder found in the same directory as the CMM jar file
3. Upon CMM application startup, a prompt will popup with 3 options : `Add On Imports`, `Start New Using Import`, `Don't Import`

![importPopUpUi](images/importPopUpMessage.png)

**Import options**

`Add On Imports`
- Adds on new imports into existing database

`Start New Using Import`
- Exports and reset the current database. CMM will then populate the reset database with new imports
- Previous database **before import** can be found in a Csv file under the "data" folder found in the same directory as the CMM jar file. It will have the following file name : `export[Date HH:MM:SS].csv`

`Don't Import`
- CMM will not import anything and application will startup normally
- Closing the prompt will also choose this option

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** Currently, import is **irreversible**. Please double check before importing. This is especially important when choosing the add on import option.
</div>

**Things to note**
* CMM will prompt user for imports upon **every** application startup.
* CMM will not import data rows with missing details (Compulsory for data to have `name`, `phone`, `email` filled)
* CMM will treat two people with the exact `name`, `phone`, `email`  as duplicates
* CMM will update duplicate imports **only when** import status has been called.
* Import is only allowed during application startup. To import after the startup, simply reopen application to get the import prompt
* Unsuccessful file import will result in an empty database. The previous database can be recovered in the latest export file.

**Common Issues**

* `CSV file not found in data\import.csv` message was shown. <br/>
    * This could either mean that the file **does not exist** at the specified location or <br/>
    * The file was **incorrectly named**. File has to be named `import.csv`
* `Missing/Extra Headers, Please check file` message was shown<br/>
   * **Files has invalid headers** <br/>
        * First row of Excel file is reserved for datatype headers. <br/>
        * Headers must include `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Interest` and `Called` from the left to right, starting from the cell 'A1' <br/>
        * Headers are not case-sensitive<br/>
    * File may have **incorrect CSV type**. Please refer to this [guide](SettingImportFileType.md)
   to correctly format your file.
* `Wrong header detected,please double check file` message was shown. <br/>
    * **Files has invalid headers**. Please refer to Common issue `Missing/Extra Headers, Please check file` to resolve
* Data not imported despite **correct import file placement, naming AND headers** <br/>
    * File may not be in the correct CSV type. Please refer to this [guide](SettingImportFileType.md)
         to correctly format your file.
* Unable to understand why a specific row was not able to be imported <br/>
    * Row could either be duplicate or there was an error reading the row
    * Detailed reasons for any import error can be found in the logs of the CMM


### Exporting state of database
CMM is able to export the current database as semicolon delimited CSV files. As such, there is no need for you to ensure that the formatting is right for furture use.

**Steps to Export data as CSV file**
1. Closing the application in any way would prompt user to export the current database <br/>
![exportPopup](images/exportPopup.png)
2. The CMM will export the database to the data file location
3. Export file will have the following file name : `export[Date HH:MM:SS].csv` where date and time will follow your system settings

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
Csv file can be found under the "data" folder found in the same directory as the CMM jar file.
</div>


### Editing the data file (JSON)

AddressBook data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder. Data found can be found at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
