CallMeMaybe (CMM) is a **desktop app** centered for Telemarketers in aiding them in customer contact management. 
CMM provides a solution to quickly catalog people based on who has/yet to be called. 
The in-built tracking functionality serves as a reminder to reach back on previously unreachable customers
Importing of existing customer database is also supported by CMM to facilitate team-based environments.

CMM is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

If you can type fast, CMM can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
